The iPhone developer is reportedly partnering with Alibaba (BABA) to further expands its artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, according to a report by The Information. TECHnalysis Research president Bob O'Donnell discusses on Asking for a Trend how the iPhone SE, with its smaller form factor and lower price, appeals to customers who prefer compact devices. ""The [iPhone] SE has never been a huge part of the iPhone market in terms of a percentage, but there is a very distinct group of people who just don't really like huge phones. And, the SE has served that market,"" O'Donnell says. While the SE may not drive massive sales, it serves a niche market, particularly in emerging regions where its affordability is key. O'Donnell comments on Apple's new AI partnership with Alibaba as the tech giant seeks to further penetrate China's consumer tech market: ""This is something that we knew had to be coming, not necessarily with Alibaba. But in order for Apple to bring Apple intelligence to China they were going to have to find a Chinese partner, and it's well known that Chinese consumers are very interested in AI capabilities.""

The social media platform pleads its case before the January 19 deadline for the divest-or-ban to take effect. CNET technology reporter Abrar Al-Heeti joins Brad Smith on Wealth to discuss what users should expect as a TikTok ban looms. ""Come January 19th, if TikTok gets banned, it's not going to magically disappear from your device,"" Al-Heeti explains. ""Instead, you won't be getting updates, which means that over time, it becomes more laggy and then eventually unusable."" She notes that Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google will be fined if TikTok and updates are available on their app stores. Al-Heeti suggests saving videos on your that you want to keep, whether you posted them or another user, from the platform. She adds that Meta's (META) Instagram Reels have been a ""strong TikTok competitor"" and could be an alternate platform for users to shift to, while Snapchat (SNAP) could be another option.

The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn't seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, “Hey, Siri.""",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b92a7bcb03782b45ba700232c18f9c0fe84fd31a6f2f34585b2a9c1e6caa3b71

However, a key question for 2025 remains: Can the Magnificent Seven continue outperforming in 2025? Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, joins Madison Mills and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share his 2025 outlook on the Magnificent Seven and broader market trends. O’Rourke notes that Tesla's vehicle delivery underperformance in the fourth quarter could be a useful reality check for investors in terms of Magnificent Seven stocks as a whole. Despite Tesla's 2024 market gains, O'Rourke suggests, ""You don't have to come out of the market, but you should be looking elsewhere for a little more, you know, protection, a little more value cushion."" He elaborates, noting that the tides are changing within the Magnificent Seven, which could make those stocks less reliable. He warns, ""The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection."" Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value. ""We're making a single bet on this handful of mega caps that are going to drive everything ... as a long-term investor, you want to be buying things that represent value, that are going to be good for the next several years.""
